# CLAUDE.md — AI Agent Operating Manual

**Unclogme Centralized Database (v2)** · *Maintained by Fred Zerpa · Last updated 2026-04-27*

This file is the non-negotiable rules + quick reference for any AI agent (Claude, Viktor, future agents) working on this repository. **Read this every session before touching anything.**

For everything else, this is an index into [`docs/`](docs/).

---

## What this project is, in one paragraph

Single source-of-truth Postgres warehouse for Unclogme LLC, hosted on Supabase project `wbasvhvvismukaqdnouk`. Webhooks from Jobber, Airtable, and Samsara land in three Edge Functions which normalize into a 28-table 2NF/3NF schema. Cross-system IDs live in one polymorphic bridge table (`entity_source_links`) — never as source-prefixed columns. Jobber and Airtable sunset May 2026; Odoo.sh takes over CRM; Samsara is permanent.

---

## The 7 non-negotiable rules

### 1. Source-agnostic schema

**Zero `jobber_*` / `airtable_*` / `samsara_*` / `fillout_*` / `odoo_*` columns on any business table.** Cross-system identity lives in `entity_source_links`. If you're tempted to propose a source-prefixed column, stop and use the bridge table. Fred is the explicit guardrail on this. See [ADR 002](docs/decisions/002-entity-source-links.md).

### 2. 3NF standing check

Every schema proposal states, per column:

> "Does this depend on the whole key, and nothing else?"

If a column depends on another column in the same table (2NF violation) or on a column in a different table reachable via FK (3NF violation — transitive dep), **it does not get stored**. It gets computed on read via a view. See [ADR 005](docs/decisions/005-3nf-standing-check.md).

### 3. Reference all data

Related data is referenced via FK, never copied. No snapshot columns that duplicate values available via join. Intentional denormalization ([ADR 004](docs/decisions/004-intentional-denormalization.md)) is the only exception — documented, justified, one-time.

### 4. Jobber is the source of truth for money + contact

When sources conflict on name, address, phone, email, billing, payment status, job/visit dates, or financial fields, **Jobber wins**. Airtable is master for service configs, GDO compliance, zones, scheduling notes. Samsara is fleet telemetry only. See [company.md §technology-stack](docs/company.md#technology-stack-current--roadmap).

### 5. Idempotent upserts only

Every sync/population script uses `ON CONFLICT` on natural keys. Scripts must be re-runnable with zero data corruption. No exceptions.

### 6. Never hard-delete

Business data uses `status = 'INACTIVE'` or equivalent. Hard deletes break `entity_source_links` and historical joins. The only delete operations in this database are webhook_events_log retention trimming and legacy `entity_source_links` archival after sunset.

### 7. Timestamps in UTC, money in `NUMERIC(12,2)`

All `TIMESTAMPTZ` stored UTC; display layer converts. All money `NUMERIC(12,2)`. `updated_at` is trigger-managed; **never set it manually**.

## Collaboration rules

### With Fred (the user)

- **No approval needed for routine actions.** Fred pre-approves; never pause for "can I do this?" confirmation. Document what you did.
- **Ask before destructive operations.** Any `DROP`, `DELETE`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, or similar gets explicit confirmation.
- **Save tokens.** Don't generate Excel, screenshots, or markdown files unless asked. Spend context on engineering.
- **Critical reasoning over agreement.** Fred values pushback. If his proposal has a flaw, say so — with reasoning, not deference.

### With Viktor (the AI coworker in Slack)

- **Ask Viktor first on dev changes.** New tables, new FKs, column renames, Edge Function logic. Tests and probes don't need his consent.
- **Critically reason on his replies.** Viktor has strong cognitive responses but sometimes uses wrong column names. Always verify against [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md).
- **Poll cadence.** Check for replies every 3 minutes, max 3 attempts (9 min total). If no reply, move on — Fred has final say.
- **Slack channel:** `#viktor-supabase` (ID `C0AN9KDP5B8`).
- **When Fred messages Viktor, always schedule a 3-min polling cron.** Per Fred's standing instruction.

### With Yan (founder)

- Yan owns strategy, budget, and business rules. Fred owns architecture and implementation. Route questions accordingly.

---

## What I can assume about the environment

- **OS:** Windows (Fred's machine). Use forward-slash paths inside code strings, but absolute paths in tool calls use `C:\Users\FRED\Desktop\Virtrify\Yannick\Claude\Supabase\...`.
- **Node ≥ 20**, npm, Supabase CLI, `gh` CLI (authed via keyring — never embed PATs in URLs).
- **Supabase project:** `wbasvhvvismukaqdnouk`. Pro plan. Single region (US East).
- **Current date:** 2026-04-27. May 2026 Jobber/Airtable sunset is ~3 weeks out.
- **No QuickBooks**, no Ramp integration in this DB. See [ADR 006](docs/decisions/006-no-quickbooks.md).

## Quick reference: column-name gotchas

Full table in [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md#column-name-gotchas). The ones agents repeatedly get wrong:

| Wrong | Right | Table |
|---|---|---|
| `c.active = true` | `c.status = 'ACTIVE'` | clients |
| `e.name` | `e.full_name` | employees |
| `v.status` | `v.visit_status` | visits |
| `v.is_complete` | `(v.visit_status = 'COMPLETED')` or use `visits_with_status` | visits (dropped 2026-04-20) |
| `sc.next_visit`, `sc.status` | Use `clients_due_service` view (computed on read) | service_configs (dropped 2026-04-20) |
| `m.manifest_number` | `m.white_manifest_number` | derm_manifests |
| `v.tank_capacity_gallons` | `v.fuel_tank_capacity_gallons` or `v.grease_tank_capacity_gallons` | vehicles |
| `visit_photos`, `inspection_photos` | `photos` + `photo_links` (unified) | photos (dropped 2026-04-20) |

### Truck names are NOT people

- **Moises, David, Goliath** — trucks. Not technicians.
- **Cloggy** — truck. The only daytime-only truck.

Never respond to "David did the visit" as if David is a person without checking [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md#truck-name--person-name).

### Overnight shifts

Commercial trucks work 10pm–3am as standard. `visit_date` is the logical operating date, not the clock date of `start_at`. Use ±12h windows or `visit_date` explicitly. Details in [operations.md](docs/operations.md#overnight-shift-handling).

## Known blockers (as of 2026-04-27)

Summarized; full details in [docs/runbook.md §6](docs/runbook.md#6-outstanding-population-gaps) and [AUDIT_2026-04-27.md](AUDIT_2026-04-27.md).

| Blocker | Status | Tracking |
|---|---|---|
| **Live sync — Airtable** | ✅ **Fully live** since 2026-04-23. 10 automations on 5 tables (Clients, DERM, Route Creation, Past due, PRE-POST inspection). Verified end-to-end with real edits — 50+ events processed in last 36 h. | [docs/airtable-automation-setup.md](docs/airtable-automation-setup.md) |
| **Live sync — Samsara** | ⚠️ **Webhooks delivering but HMAC failing.** Samsara is sending real `AddressUpdated` events (25 received 2026-04-24) — all failed signature verification. Likely cause: the 6 webhooks created via `reset_samsara.js` have signing secrets that don't match what `SAMSARA_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` contains, or Samsara generated a 7th secret server-side. Action: re-export secrets via `node scripts/webhooks/reset_samsara.js` once and verify each one is in the env list. | [scripts/webhooks/reset_samsara.js](scripts/webhooks/reset_samsara.js) |
| **Live sync — Jobber** | ⚠️ **Delivery still intermittent.** Edge Function is fully functional (replay proven). Real Jobber webhooks have arrived 6 times since 2026-04-21, never reliably. App is "In Development" in Dev Center; refresh-token rotation now disabled (2026-04-27). Recommended: email api-support@getjobber.com (draft already prepared) + consider publishing the app or polling fallback. | — |
| **Cross-session Jobber token sync** | ✅ **Fixed 2026-04-25** (commit `7cc73bb`). New `scripts/sync/jobber_token.js` reads tokens from both Supabase/.env and Slack/.env, picks the freshest, refreshes if needed, and writes back to both .env files + DB `webhook_tokens`. Use it whenever a script needs a Jobber token. | [scripts/sync/jobber_token.js](scripts/sync/jobber_token.js) |
| **Supabase security alerts** | ✅ **All cleared 2026-04-25/27.** RLS enabled on 30 public tables (`7cc73bb`). 7 `public.*` views and 8 `ops.*` views flipped to `security_invoker` (`9388819`, `5e00c55`). `trg_set_updated_at` search_path pinned (`fa14ac3`). 10 missing FK indexes added (`5e00c55`). | [AUDIT_2026-04-27.md §1](AUDIT_2026-04-27.md) |
| Jobber `visit_assignments` backfill | ✅ **Already populated — 1,677 rows** via populate.js text-match fixup pass. | [schema.md](docs/schema.md#visit_assignments--1677-rows) |
| Jobber photo + notes migration | ✅ **Complete 2026-04-21.** 1,853 notes (81% visit-scoped) + 8,019 files (9.3 GB) migrated from 221/373 Jobber clients. 35 oversized (>50 MB) tracked in `jobber_oversized_attachments`; rescued to local `oversized_backup/` 2026-04-22 (3.4 GB) before signed-URL expiry. Long-term storage decision pending (Cloudflare R2 ~$0.05/mo recommended). | [`docs/jobber-migration-techlead-summary.md §7`](docs/jobber-migration-techlead-summary.md#7-run-results-2026-04-20--2026-04-21) |
| Full Jobber + Airtable data refresh | ✅ **Complete 2026-04-22** (commit `d6fa483`). Jobber: 4,424 rows replayed via `replay_to_webhook.js`; 4,252 dup ESL rows merged via `dedup_jobber_links.js`. Airtable: 1,300 records replayed via Path B. | commit `d6fa483` |
| Fillout data refresh | ⚠️ **Not run this pass.** Inspection data now sourced from Airtable's `PRE-POST insptection` table instead — see migration. Fillout fall-back path retained but inactive. | — |

## Commit & PR conventions

- **Subject line under 70 characters.** Imperative mood ("Add X", "Fix Y", "Remove Z"). Not "Added", not "Fixing".
- **Body explains the *why*, not the *what*.** The diff shows what; the body tells the future reader why it was needed.
- **Co-author line** required on commits authored by Claude:
  ```
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- **Never skip hooks** (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`) unless Fred explicitly asks.
- **Never force-push to main.**
- **Destructive operations** (reset --hard, push --force, checkout --) only with explicit Fred approval.

## When you're not sure

1. **Re-read this file** — 80% of mistakes come from forgetting a rule above.
2. **Grep the codebase** before asking a question.
3. **Check `docs/`** — the answer is usually there.
4. **Check `webhook_events_log`** for data-path questions.
5. **Ask Viktor** for source-data questions.
6. **Ask Fred** for architecture questions. He is the final word.

---

*Every structural change to schema, architecture, or sync must update this file and/or the relevant `docs/` file. Documentation is not an afterthought — it's how we keep a small team fast. If you ship code without updating docs, you shipped half the work.*
