-- 2026-07-17 — effective driver = active crew, else inspection-derived actual driver, else any crew
--
-- WHY: Jobber's assignedUsers sometimes records the office DISPATCHER (e.g. Ishad Knight, id 8,
-- Office/INACTIVE) instead of the field driver. On 39 recent visits Ishad was the sole assignee.
-- Recovery via the PRE/POST shift inspections (the driver fills them AT the truck) showed Ishad was
-- in fact a real, now-former driver of the Moises truck Jun 8-19 (his own inspections) — so those
-- attributions are CORRECT — but on Jun 1-4 the Moises inspections were filled by Aaron (ACTIVE),
-- proving Aaron drove while Jobber mis-assigned Ishad. Fred: "recover the real driver."
--
-- FIX: the effective driver (fed to driver_id/name/role/color) is now a COALESCE ladder:
--   (1) the ACTIVE Jobber-assigned crew member (min id) — the normal case, unchanged;
--   (2) when the crew has NO active member, the employee who did the PRE/POST inspection on the
--       GPS-CONFIRMED truck (v.vehicle_id, NOT a line-item default) on visit_date +/-1 — the real
--       operator, choosing SAME-DAY first then active then nearest-date (recovers Aaron on the
--       Moises truck for late-May..Jun-4; keeps a same-day former driver like Kevis where he truly
--       drove). Donald Barron has 0 inspections ever (never operated a truck) so his Jobber name-tag
--       is correctly overridden by the actual operator;
--   (3) else any assigned crew member (min id, incl. inactive FORMER drivers like Steven/Donald/
--       Ishad on the days they truly drove) — unchanged;
--   (4) COALESCE with assigned_driver_id (planned) as before.
-- Only visits whose crew has no ACTIVE member reach steps 2-3 (COALESCE short-circuits), so the
-- common active-crew path is untouched. Replaces the old first_assignment min(employee_id) CTE.
-- Depends on the ghost reconcile + FULL-SYNC trigger (2026-07-17_reconcile_visit_assignments_to_team.sql)
-- so visit_assignments already == the current Jobber crew.
--
-- AUDIT (ADR-010): view only, no audited table changes.
-- ROLLBACK: restore backups/2026-07-17_v_calendar_visit_before_inspection_driver.sql.
