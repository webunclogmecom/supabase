-- 2026-07-16_v_calendar_visit_sa_group.sql
-- Add sa_group to ops.v_calendar_visit so the Visit Calendar search can COLOUR its SA chips.
--
-- WHY: the search dropdown lists a client's VISITS, each with a chip from
-- ops.v_calendar_visit.service_kind ('SA' | 'SC'). A client with two Service Agreements therefore
-- shows a column of identical "SA" chips with no way to tell which agreement a visit belongs to.
-- Real case (Fred, 2026-07-16) - 195-MYK "Myka Lincoln LLC" alternates two SAs:
--   job 1586 #99900853 -> line item 01 (Pumping - Grease Trap)  -> PUMPING_GT
--   job 1585 #99900854 -> line item 06 (Cleaning - Aux)         -> CLEANING
--
-- GROUPS + COLOURS come from Yannick's "Service list Unclogme" sheet, column B (SA rows only):
--   01,02 Pumping/Grease Trap        PUMPING_GT           #5B0F00 dark red berry
--   03,04 Pumping/Grey Water+Lift St PUMPING_OTHER        #B7B7B7 grey
--   05,06,07 Cleaning                CLEANING             #4A86E8 cornflower blue
--   08 Warranty of Drainage          WARRANTY_OF_DRAINAGE (no fill)
-- The HEX stays in the app (presentation); this view returns only the stable GROUP KEY. Group logic
-- lives once in ops.fn_service_group() (added 2026-07-16_client_service_options_service_group.sql).
--
-- ⚠ NAME COLLISION - do not conflate: ops.v_calendar_visit.service_kind means 'SA'/'SC', while
-- public.service_line_items.service_kind means 'Pumping'/'Cleaning'. Hence the new column is named
-- sa_group, not service_group.
--
-- RESOLUTION: sa_group mirrors the view's existing effv (vehicle) lateral exactly - the visit's OWN
-- line items first, falling back to the job template (visit-scoped COALESCE job-scoped, per
-- docs/reference/line-item-lifecycle-and-jobber-edit-ripple.md). It takes the LOWEST code's group,
-- i.e. the job's primary/headline service.
--
-- APP RULE: colour ONLY when the chip is 'SA'. 7 SC visits legitimately carry an SA-coded line item
-- (the SA/SC chip is a heuristic on frequency/title, the group comes from line items) - those keep
-- their plain SC chip. 280 SA visits on legacy jobs resolve to NULL -> plain chip. Never a hard fail.
--
-- SAFE/ADDITIVE: all existing columns keep name, type and ORDER; sa_group is appended LAST.
-- Verified: 1587 rows before = 1587 after; ops.v_route_today unaffected; 195-MYK now splits
-- PUMPING_GT (job 1586) vs CLEANING (job 1585).
-- AUDIT (ADR 010): view-only, no DML => no audit trigger applies.
-- REVERSIBLE: backups/2026-07-16_ops_v_calendar_visit_before.sql
