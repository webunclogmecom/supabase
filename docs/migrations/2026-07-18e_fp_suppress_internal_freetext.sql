-- 2026-07-18e — Field Portal: DEFAULT-DENY on internal free text (Fred: "filter out internal notes so
-- nothing internal shows to clients")
--
-- FINDING: every free-text field the customer receipt renders is unvetted CREW shorthand. There is no
-- customer-facing flag anywhere to separate "internal" from "client-safe", and a keyword denylist cannot be
-- trusted for a customer-facing leak (e.g. "switch covers" carries no internal marker yet is plainly a crew
-- note). So both channels are suppressed at the view — default-deny, not heuristics.
--
--  1) customer.work_orders.notes  -> NULL::text
--     ALL 9 non-empty visits.notes in the entire DB are internal crew shorthand, several naming staff:
--       "Jermain backflow replacement" · "run all hose in parking, ask AA for more instructions"
--       "Ava clean out creation 3\" pvc pipe grease trap" · "bad smell check why pls" · "switch covers"
--       "install manholes" · "3 inch oatey cup" · "cover replacement on gt 6,7,8"
--       "the Line in the garage make sure all the dishwasher are running good …"
--     (2026-07-18d had pointed this at the real v.notes; that surfaced exactly one to a client — 168-AVA
--     "run all hose in parking, ask AA for more instructions" — which is what prompted this.)
--
--  2) customer.wo_photos.caption -> NULL::text
--     Of 305 photos only 19 carry a caption, 5 distinct values: "All done" (6), "Job done" (5), whitespace
--     (3), "There is construction work in the area of the grease traps" (1), and 4x the crew-to-crew
--     "Done need to put rubber in all whole plz an glue so I can do my plz thank you check all the whole for
--     rubber missing". Net: no customer value, one real leak. The PHOTOS still render — only the caption text
--     is withheld.
--
-- No frontend change / no publish: the FP renders both conditionally, so they simply stop appearing (and the
-- FP Lovable project must not be published right now — it holds another session's unpublished edits, rule #13).
--
-- ⚠ IF customer-visible notes are ever wanted, do NOT re-expose visits.notes — add an explicit, deliberate
-- customer-facing field (e.g. visits.customer_note) and surface THAT. Default-deny is the invariant here.
-- FP CLAUDE.md rule #7 (no internal content on the portal) is the governing rule.
--
-- SCOPE: only the notes and caption expressions; column names/types/positions unchanged, and every other
-- column (services/service_items/service_type, decal, FOG-blackout rd.url + receipt_doc_class joins) verbatim.
-- AUDIT (ADR-010): views only.
-- ROLLBACK: backups/2026-07-18e_customer_work_orders_before_notes_suppress.sql
