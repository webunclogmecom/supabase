-- 2026-08-21 19:40 ET  Add the missing deleted_at filters to four views
-- ============================================================================
-- Found by a durable-correctness audit in which every finding was put to an adversarial refuter.
-- 705 of 2,507 rows in public.visits carry deleted_at, so this class is live, not theoretical.
--
--   ops.v_calendar_visit   1 of 1,384 rows wrong today. Four CTEs (last_completed, observed_cadence,
--                          observed_price, observed_job_cadence) scan visits unfiltered while the
--                          ADJACENT prev_live CTE and the outer query both filter. That asymmetry is
--                          what makes it an omission rather than a design.
--   derm.visits            2 of 1,057 rows (visits 5839, 6831) render as live completed visits.
--   derm.manifest_visits   0 today, latent. Reachable: delete_calendar_visit has no link check and
--                          the nightly orphan branch has no visit_status filter.
--   public.visits_recent   588 of 1,500 rows. Worst by volume, but NOTHING reads it (0 hits across
--                          8 bundles walked to closure, 0 PostgREST calls in 37h of
--                          pg_stat_statements). It is what docs/onboarding.md tells every new hire
--                          to run as their first read of real data. Also gains the upper date bound
--                          its own name and docs promise: it currently spans to 2027-12-31.
--
-- SCOPE, MEASURED, so nobody reads this as a behaviour change:
--   ops.v_calendar_visit frequency_days / late_status / service_kind change on 0 of 1,802 rows.
--   The due/late chip is NOT wrong today and this does not fix it. The single user-visible
--   correction is last_completed_date on visit 7027: 2026-06-29 (sourced from soft-deleted visit
--   6831) becomes 2026-06-24. Ship as latent hardening.
--
-- METHOD, per CLAUDE.md "COPY THE WHOLE BODY, NEVER RETYPE IT": every body below was GENERATED
-- from live pg_get_viewdef and edited by anchored string replacement, each asserting an exact
-- occurrence count (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively). Nothing was retyped. CREATE OR REPLACE, never
-- DROP, so grants survive (see the "DROP VIEW discards grants" rule).
--
-- Audit rule 8: all four are VIEWS. No triggers, no audit opt-in required.
