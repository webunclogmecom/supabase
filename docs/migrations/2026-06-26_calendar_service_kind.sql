-- ops.v_calendar_visit: add service_kind ('SA' Service Agreement / 'SC' Service Call) for the
-- calendar chip's right-pinned badge. Derived from the linked job (LEFT JOIN jobs jb on v.job_id):
--   title-first (matches ops.client_service_options' 'Service Agreement%' convention, and survives
--   the JOBS-poll frequency sync gap), then fall back to a recurring frequency.
-- Rule, verified against live data 2026-06-26 (1420 visit-linked jobs → SA 722 / SC 698; 1 no-job → NULL):
--   * title contains 'Service Agreement' -> 'SA'  (incl. sync-gap rows w/ frequency_days NULL/0, e.g. 214-MYK Grey Water,
--                                                   and word-order variants like 'Grease Trap Service Agreement')
--   * title contains 'Service Call'       -> 'SC'  (no such job carries frequency_days > 0 — no contradiction)
--   * frequency_days > 0                  -> 'SA'  (129 legacy recurring jobs with descriptive titles, e.g. "Grease Trap Pumping")
--   * else                                -> 'SC'  (one-offs: emergency calls, [OLD] jobs, freq=0 — correctly land here)
-- NB1: frequency_days uses > 0 (NOT "IS NOT NULL") — freq=0 is the data's "one-off" sentinel (caught visit 6556
--      "Service Call" freq=0, which IS NOT NULL would have mislabeled SA).
-- NB2: title match is CONTAINS ('%...%') not leading-prefix — a 3-lens adversarial review found a leading-prefix anchor
--      misses 'Grease Trap Service Agreement' (freq=0 -> wrongly SC). Contains-match flips exactly 1 live row (id 1468
--      112-YA SC->SA) and zero others; verified no 'Service Call' appears mid-title so widening Call is safe too.
-- Additive: service_kind appended as the LAST column so CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW accepts it. Rule 7 (derived on read).
