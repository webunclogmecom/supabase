-- 2026-07-13 — ops.v_calendar_visit.amount: invoice-price read-through (SC price capture)
--
-- WHY: Diego prices Service Calls $0 at scheduling then sets the real price on the Jobber INVOICE
-- days later (he works in Jobber, not our apps). handleInvoice already syncs the invoice's real-priced
-- lines (invoice-scoped line_items) + stamps visits.invoice_id, but the Calendar amount only read the
-- visit/job scopes, so it stayed $0. New precedence: (1) the visit's own PRICED lines, else (2) the
-- Jobber invoice total when the visit is 1:1-invoiced (batch invoices covering >1 visit are skipped via
-- the =1 guard so we never double-count), else (3) the SA job template, else (4) the raw own-lines
-- (keeps genuinely-$0/uninvoiced visits at $0). Read-through only — NO data writes, self-heals as Diego
-- re-prices. Only ops.v_calendar_visit.amount changes; v_revenue_summary already uses real invoice
-- totals. Rollback: backups/2026-07-13_v_calendar_visit_before.sql. View-only (no table/trigger change).
