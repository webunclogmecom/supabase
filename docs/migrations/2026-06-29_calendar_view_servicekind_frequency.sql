-- Migration: 2026-06-29_calendar_view_servicekind_frequency
-- Author: Claude (Opus 4.8) for Fred
-- Audit: N/A (view; no table audit trigger). Reads only; no data mutation.
--
-- WHY (two derivation fixes to ops.v_calendar_visit, no column/shape change):
--  1) service_kind: line-item code class is now a tiebreaker AFTER the job-title
--     regex and BEFORE the frequency fallback. Visits whose job title matches
--     neither %Service Agreement% nor %Service Call% but that carry SA-coded
--     items (01-08, and no SC item 09-24) are SA (and vice-versa). Fixes 11
--     visits that fell through to ELSE SC while carrying real 01/02/04 SA items.
--     Genuine SC jobs (title literally Service Call, e.g. visit 5830) keep SC --
--     title still wins, codes only break true ambiguity.
--  2) frequency_days (+ the late_status CASE that shares it): now prefers the
--     JOB Frequency field -- COALESCE(NULLIF(jb.frequency_days,0), sc.frequency_days,
--     oc.median_gap_days). The generator spaces visits to jobs.frequency_days, so
--     the view now displays the same number the visits are actually spaced to.
--     NULLIF(...,0) is REQUIRED: one-off jobs store frequency_days=0 (not NULL);
--     a bare COALESCE would collapse 225 SC rows to 0. With NULLIF only 95 rows
--     change -- 70 NULL->job-freq (incl 22 TCE locations + 186-PV CL) and 25
--     mislabel corrections (147-OST Maison Ostrow 56->60, 083-SHUL 45->30,
--     099-PV 60->90, 195-MYK 60->30). No row goes to 0.
--
-- Verified before apply (dry-run): exactly 11 SC->SA flips, 5830 stays SC, no
-- SA->SC flips; 63 columns unchanged; rowcount 1425 stable.
-- Replaces the service_kind block from 2026-06-26_calendar_service_kind.sql and
-- keeps the truck default-map (2026-06-27_default_trucks_by_line_item.sql) intact.
