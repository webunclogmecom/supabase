-- DO NOT APPLY THIS FILE AS-IS - IT IS A STALE SNAPSHOT (flagged 2026-08-03).
--
-- These checked-in view definitions have drifted from the live database, and
-- re-applying one REVERTS whatever shipped since it was captured. Measured
-- 2026-08-03 against Prod:
--   * 06_v_derm_compliance.sql still filters unmatched_visits on
--     service_type = GT. LIVE uses derm_required (ADR 018, line-item-derived).
--     Applying the file would revert DERM-required to the unreliable proxy.
--   * v_calendar_visit.sql is 6.3 KB against a 13.6 KB live definition, i.e.
--     roughly half the view is missing.
--
-- They also carry the legacy GT/CL/WD/LS vocabulary, retired on 2026-08-03.
-- REGENERATE FROM LIVE (pg_get_viewdef) before trusting or applying any of them.
-- Tracked in docs/plans/2026-08-03_service_type_vocabulary_migration_plan.md.
